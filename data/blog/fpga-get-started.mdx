summary: 'Getting started with FPGA development using Tang Nano 20K and ZYNQ platforms'
---

## Hardware Setup

I currently have two FPGA development boards:

1. **Xilinx ZYNQ 7010**: While powerful for complex designs, it's oversized for my initial learning projects
2. **Tang Nano 20K**: A more suitable board for beginners
   - Cost: 168 RMB
   - Manufacturer: Sipeed ([Product Wiki](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-nano-20k/nano-20k.html))
   - Architecture: Gowin FPGA

## Learning Resources

I plan to follow these tutorials:
1. [ASIC World Verilog Tutorials](https://www.asic-world.com/verilog/index.html) - For Verilog fundamentals
2. [HDLBits Problem Sets](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Problem_sets#Getting_Started) - For practical exercises

## Possible Project Roadmap
- UART communication
- VGA output
- Memory controllers
- Simple CPU design
