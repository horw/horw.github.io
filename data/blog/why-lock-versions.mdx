Version locking is a critical practice in software development that helps ensure consistency and reliability across different environments.

## A Real-World Example

Recently, I encountered an issue in a CI pipeline where a seemingly straightforward Python build process failed. Here's the original workflow:

```yaml
name: Test Build Python Packages

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test-build-packages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.7'
      - name: Build packages
        run: |
          bash foreach.sh build
```

The pipeline failed with this error:

```
Error: The version '3.7' with architecture 'x64' was not found for Ubuntu 24.04.
```

## What Went Wrong?

The issue arose because the workflow used `ubuntu-latest`, which automatically upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04.
This newer version of Ubuntu doesn't support Python 3.7, creating an incompatibility that broke the build process.

## Solutions and Best Practices

There are two immediate solutions to this problem:

1. **Update Python Version**:
   ```yaml
   python-version: '3.10'  # Use a newer Python version
   ```

2. **Lock Ubuntu Version**:
   ```yaml
   runs-on: ubuntu-22.04  # Lock to a specific Ubuntu version
   ```

However, this incident highlights a broader principle: the importance of version locking across your entire stack.

## Why Version Locking Matters

Version locking provides several key benefits. It’s possible to list many of them, but these two are the most important, IMHO:

1. **Reproducibility**: Ensures that builds are consistent across different environments and times
2. **Time Savings**: Prevents unexpected failures that require immediate fixes

## Updated Example

```yaml
name: Test Build Python Packages

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test-build-packages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.7'
      - name: Build packages
        run: |
          bash foreach.sh build
```

## Conclusion

Remember: Version locking isn’t about avoiding updates; it’s about controlling when and how updates happen on your terms.

Save your time by avoiding unnecessary waste...
