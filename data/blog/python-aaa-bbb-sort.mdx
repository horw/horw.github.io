It's a funny story about "5 min" programming.

I follow @yegor256's channel and he posted something like:

`
Let me remind you that if you are a fan of the "Elegant Objects" programming paradigm, you may add yourself to the list of fans at elegantobjects.org (https://www.elegantobjects.org/) â€” just send a pull request (https://github.com/yegor256/elegantobjects.github.io/) and you will be there.
`

Since I had read this book, I thought I'd add myself as a follower. I tried to do it, but it was challenging because he required names to be in aaA bbB ccC order. I thought "hah, easy, let's Python it!" But then I got stuck because Python sorts lexicographically, not in the way I mentioned.

I searched for resources and found some information about sorting, for example this one:
https://learnpython.com/blog/sort-alphabetically-in-python/

As a result, I wrote a function to do it, which was quite amusing. Here's the main part of the function:

```python
def sort_key(fan):
    """
    Sorting key for fans:
    1. Sort by the first letter of the nickname (case-insensitive).
    2. If the first letter is the same, sort by whether it's uppercase.
    3. Finally, sort alphabetically by the full nickname.
    """
    _nickname = fan[1]
    return (
        _nickname[0].lower(),
        _nickname[0].isupper(),
        _nickname.lower(),
    )
```
